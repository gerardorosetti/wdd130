                <p>Hi! My name is Gerardo Sayago and I’m just a gamer with the enough programming knowledge to create and design a web page where people can take a lot to my reviews and some information about my favorite videogames. I started playing videogames since I am just a child, my father introduced me into the gaming world buying me a psx, where I used to play mostly Crash Team Racing (11/10 game btw) since that I started playing with more consoles like the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, some XBOX 360 in a friends house, A lot, and I mean a lot of videogames with the PlayStation 3 when there was the big fame of the Black Ops 2 videogame, playing a lot of hours the Zombies mode, and after that age, in these lately years I just started playing more PC games, specially the competitive ones, Like Dota 2, Counter Strike Global Offensive, and even some League of Legends with friends, so yeah I consider that I have been a passionate person for videogames expending a lot of hours on them, so I also consider I have experience and knowledge about them so I am able to make trustfully reviews and look for the most important and best information. In summary me, a person that got involved into a giant world full of entertainment, I am able to make a good webpage with the best content. so, talking about this section, in this part you are going to see my a short speach of who I am and why I am doing this, and also you would be able to go to the other parts of the webpage, if you are looking for specific information or a specific review that will be at the “Information” or “Reviews” sections/pages.</p>
