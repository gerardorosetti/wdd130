    <h2>Saymed</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, My name is Gerardo Sayago, but you can call me Saymed, that is my nickname for almost every videogame I play.<br>
        I am 21 years old and I am currently studying System Engineering at the Universidad de los Andes here in Venezuela at the same time I am taking this course.<br>
        My hobbies are playing videogames and watch some series or animes, I mostly like online and competitive videogames like Dota 2 but I also like videogames like the Dark Souls trilogy.<br>
        I really love the programming world, I really feel it is something that fills me with pation so I am looking to learn more and more while testing most of the working fields while I decide which of them should I take to asimilate it as my future work :D.
